    Klogg started as a fork of glogg log viewer but now it
    is far more advanced. It is a C++ cross-platform 
    desktop application built using Qt and Intel TBB libraries.
    The main focus is performance. Klogg is my tool of choice 
    for analyzing multi-gigabyte log files.

    Dropbox Fake is an implementation of Dropbox REST API v1 that can be used for testing.

    of REST API v2 that is used at Kaspersky.
